# iOSNotesApp-CWC
## Purpose/Description
This project was created using a tutorial provided by Code with Chris (CWC) and was my first personally developed full-stack application. The server for this application can be found in a separate repository.
The purpose of this project was to be a learning exercise, and not to be deployed to the app store.

## Scope
Despite being built using a tutorial, there were still many bugs that had to be resolved and improvements that I (Eric Burrell) deemed necessary. These were address solely by me, and without the additional help of the tutorial. The app is now functional, yet is lacking certain expected features of a robust Notes App, such as a search function. As this was a training exercise, these features will not be added any time in the future.
